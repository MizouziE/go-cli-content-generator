Once upon a time, in a pond far away, a happy frog patiently waited for her friend. She was happily hopping in circles, perching herself gracefully on lily pads and singing. Every time she sung, it put a smile on her face, as she reminded herself of why she was waiting. 

Her friend was coming over to join her for a picnic. They had been planning this for weeks and it was finally happening! The frog was in utter excitement; she had packed the whole pond with her favorite fruits and vegetables like dragon fruits, grapes, and carrots for them to nibble on. 

Finally, there it was, her friend hopping alongside her. The little frog was so overjoyed that she jumped for joy and hugged her friend tightly. Now the two of them could enjoy their picnic together, taking in the beauty of their pond, not having a care in the world.
