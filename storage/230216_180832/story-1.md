Once upon a dark night in the zoo, a clever owl was planning his escape. He noticed the security guards all followed the same pattern every night; they would patrol, then go back to the guard house and have dinner.

He would use this to his advantage. One night after dinner, the owl flew around and collected a variety of materials for a makeshift rope: cloth and metal strapping from the booths in the petting zoo, sticks and vines from mossy old trees and grass surrounding the cages.

Finally, he crafted the rope from his materials, quickly and quietly. The owl stretched the rope across a tight gap between two of the highest buildings, tying it to a nearby tree. He stepped onto the rope, and cautiously began climbing over the wall. 

When he reached the top, he took a look back at the zoo, smugly proud of his abilities. The owl's daring and creative plan had paid off, and the success of his escape would surely be remembered in the zoo's history books.
