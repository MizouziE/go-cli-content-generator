There was once a clever owl named Wilbur, who lived in the local zoo. Wilbur was unusually wise, often finding himself coming up with imaginative schemes. It wasn't until one fateful day that Wilbur came up with an idea to escape the zoo.

Gathering his wits and resources, Wilbur opened the latch on his cage when the zookeepers weren't looking. He was free. Wilbur flew over the perimeter fence and quickly made his way to the nearby forest.

Wilbur had never been this far from the zoo before and was in awe of the lush vegetation and the variety of wildlife. Wilbur eventually stumbled upon an old abandoned barn, and instead of flying away, he chose to stay for a while.

He quickly befriended the farmer who used the barn and made a cozy nest in a corner of the barn. Wilbur was happy for the first time since coming to the zoo and lived out his days on the farm, far away from his prison-like cage.
