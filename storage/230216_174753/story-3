Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little bird from the lands of the Southern regions of Kenya. He was not your everyday run of the mill pigeon, but rather a highly resourceful and ebullient being, who could brighten up even the dreariest of days.

Winter in the Southern regions of Kenya can sometimes be quite harsh and troublesome. However, that never effected this happy little bird. He spent his days fluttering around his habitat and singing cheerfully, despite the extreme weather conditions.

The bird was highly admired by his community. He often stopped by the human residence to pay a visit and they would feed him boiled peanuts and maize. After his visit, the little bird kept the humans company with his sweet chirps, while they did their chores.

The bird was, without a doubt, the happiest being in the Southern regions of Kenya. He didn't require any material possessions as he was content with the simple pleasures in life. 

He taught us to appreciate the little things and to have a positive outlook on life. He was a constant source of joy and it was always such a pleasure to have him about. His presence was a reminder that the dark clouds of life can be swept away, just by believing in the power of hope and joy.
