Jack pulled up in his truck and stepped out, whistling as he surveyed the property. He had been restoring the old house for nearly a year, and it was finally nearing completion. But, as he rounded the corner of the weathered barn, he found himself facing a terrifying sight. An enormous, coal-black dog with wild eyes, saliva dripping from its jowls and an unmistakably angry expression. He froze and tried to back away, but the dog snarled and charged forward. Jack knew this was no ordinary animal.

It's owners had disappeared months ago, leaving the monstrous beast tied up in the barn. It had become emaciated and mean spirited, the violence gleaming in its eyes. He had to escape. So, Jack ran for his life, the huge dog snapping at his heels the entire way. Luck paid off and he managed to reach his truck in time. Slamming the door and locking it, he raced off the property.

He had no idea what happened to the angry dog, but he dared not go back. He dreaded the day he would find out.

The End.
